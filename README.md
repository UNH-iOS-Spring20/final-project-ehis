My iOS development class' project... uses Swift/SwiftUI and Google's Cloud Firestore

Ever experienced the frustration of jumping through different apps looking for something to eat? Same, so I came up with FoodHub!
Why go through multiple apps when you can have one app that has all the menus and will link you to the appropriate delivery app (if available) when you've found what you'd like??
